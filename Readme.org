* scratch-pop.el

"scratch"バッファをポップアップ (・バックアップ)

pop-up (and optionaly back-up) "scratch"es

** USER-VISIBLE CHANGES IN THE LAST VERSION

- scratch-pop now keeps more older backups

  now =scratch-pop-backup-scratches= does not immediately delete
  older backups, but keeps 50 (by default) older backups.

  You can change the number of backups to keep (at most) by setting
  =scratch-pop-kept-old-backups=.

** Usage

Load this script

: (require 'scratch-pop)

and you can popup a scratch buffer with "M-x scratch-pop". If a
scratch is already displayed, new buffers (like =*scratch2*=,
=*scratch3*= ...) are created. You may also bind some keys to
"scratch-pop" if you want.

: (global-set-key "C-M-s" 'scratch-pop)

You can backup scratches by calling `scratch-pop-backup-scratches'
after setting `scratch-pop-backup-directory',

: (setq scratch-pop-backup-directory "~/.emacs.d/scratch_pop/")
: (add-hook 'kill-emacs-hook 'scratch-pop-backup-directory)

and then restore backups by calling `scratch-pop-restore-scratches'.

: (scratch-pop-restore-scratches 2) ;; restores *scratch* and *scratch2*
