* scratch-pop.el

"scratch"バッファをポップアップ (・バックアップ)

pop-up (and optionaly back-up) "scratch"es

** USER VISIBLE CHANGE IN 2.2.0

Now =scratch-pop.el= does not require =popwin.el=, and use new
function =scratch-pop-popup-buffer= to popup scratch buffers by
default.

You may restore the last behavior by =require=-ing =popwin= and change
the variable =scratch-pop-popup-function=.

: (require 'popwin)
: (setq scratch-pop-popup-function 'popwin:popup-buffer)

** Usage

Load this script

: (require 'scratch-pop)

and you can popup a scratch buffer with "M-x scratch-pop". If a
scratch is already displayed, new buffers (like =*scratch2*=,
=*scratch3*= ...) are created. You may also bind some keys to
"scratch-pop" if you want.

: (global-set-key "C-M-s" 'scratch-pop)

You can backup scratches by calling `scratch-pop-backup-scratches'
after setting `scratch-pop-backup-directory',

: (setq scratch-pop-backup-directory "~/.emacs.d/scratch_pop/")
: (add-hook 'kill-emacs-hook 'scratch-pop-backup-directory)

and then restore backups by calling `scratch-pop-restore-scratches'.

: (scratch-pop-restore-scratches 2) ;; restores *scratch* and *scratch2*
